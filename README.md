We assembled new mitochondrial genomes for over 200 platyrrhine primates with known sampling locations and used them to assess support for the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. 

Mitogenomes were assembled from Illumina short reads using the MitoFinder pipeline (https://github.com/RemiAllio/MitoFinder).
