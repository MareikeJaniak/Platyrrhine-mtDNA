# Platyrrhine-mtDNA

Code and scripts used in Platyrrhine mtDNA manuscript.

Janiak, M.C., et al. (Submitted). 205 newly-assembled mitogenomes from the speciose Amazonian primates provide mixed evidence for rivers as drivers of speciation.

We assembled new mitochondrial genomes for 200 platyrrhine primates with known sampling locations and used them to assess support for the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. 

Mitogenomes were assembled from Illumina short reads using the MitoFinder pipeline (https://github.com/RemiAllio/MitoFinder).
